                <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
                <li><a href="url">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <em>var x</em>;</li>
                <li><a href="url">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <em>var x = 10</em>;</li>
                <li><a href="url">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data types. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <em>true</em> or <em>false</em>; null- <em>null</em> aka nothing; Number - <em>42</em> or <em>3.14159</em>; String - <em>"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</em> Array - <em>[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</em> and Object - <em>{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</em></li>
                <li><a href="url">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actioon for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditioons that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <em>if</em> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <em>else</em> if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <em>else</em> we execute this block of code;</li>
                <li><a href="url">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</li>
                <li><a href="url">Function</a> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over over again.</li>
